# DocumentSuperSearch
Supersearch is a PowerShell-based document discovery tool for Word files. It searches body text, hyperlinks, and key metadata fields, then exports results to a structured Excel report. This makes it ideal for governance and audit workflows where documents must be grouped or validated by metadata such as Summary, Tags, or Enterprise Keywords.
